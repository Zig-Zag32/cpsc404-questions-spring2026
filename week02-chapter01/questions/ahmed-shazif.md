## Question

Chapter 1 argues that conflict is inevitable because managers and employees have differing agendas, and that the goal is to make that conflict productive rather than avoid it. In a real workplace, though, managers control performance reviews, assignments, and promotions—so the “conflict” isn’t between equals. How does the chapter’s advice change when the conflict is structurally unequal, and what does “productive conflict” look like when the person you disagree with also controls your outcomes?
