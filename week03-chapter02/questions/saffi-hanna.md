# Week 3 Question - Chapter 2: Giving Good-Enough Answers

**Student:** Hanna Saffi

## Question

Kousen argues that "a good-enough answer today is much better than a great answer next week" because managers often need to keep moving forward rather than wait for perfect information. However, in technical fields where incorrect estimates or incomplete answers can lead to significant downstream problems (missed deadlines, technical debt, security vulnerabilities), how do we determine when "good enough" crosses into "dangerously incomplete"? Should the threshold for "good enough" vary based on the potential consequences of being wrong?
