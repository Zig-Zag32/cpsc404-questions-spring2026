## Question

What if your good-enough answer unintentionally suggests an idea that could lead to negative consequences like layoffs or risky investments? How do you balance honesty with responsibility?

## Context (optional)

In big tech companies like Meta there is a strong push to adopt AI and I have heard that their employees are asked/required to use AI to code. And especially AI adoption is cited as a reason for their massive layoffs or restructuring. Given this sensitive problem, if your manager asks you an open-ended question about how AI could be used to automate or enhance your team’s work, it might be harder to answer.
